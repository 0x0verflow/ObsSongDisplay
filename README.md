# ObsSongDisplay
A software to shows the name and author of the current song in OBS/XSplit. Currently for Spotify only!

## How to?
### Installation
Download the software from the 'Releases'. Extract the zip file to any folder you want. Now open OBS/XSplit and create a new Text Layer (for OBS: "Text (GDI+)") that is reading its text from a file. Select the osd.txt from the folder you extracted the zip file in. That's it.

WARNING! If you move the installation folder, you need to create the text layer again!

### Usage
Open the software and start Spotify. You can minimize the software in the tray by pressing the minimize button of the window.
